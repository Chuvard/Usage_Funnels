# Usage_Funnels
SQL queries to calculate usage funnels

During this project we will analyze different Warby Parker marketing funnels in order to calculate conversion rates.
To help users find their perfect frame, Warby Parker prepared a Style Quiz with five questions, respectively.

Here are the funnels and the tables that you are given:

	1. survey (df)			- a table contains users’ responses from a Style Quiz for a particular question

	2. quiz (df) 			- a table contains information about users’ preferences from a fully completed Style Quiz
	3. home_to_purchase (df) 	- a table contains information about users’ home try on
	4. purchase (df)		- a table contains information about users’ purchases
